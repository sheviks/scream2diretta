/*
 * Diretta output backend for the Scream Unix receiver.
 *
 * Current architecture (unified PCM queue):
 *
 *   Scream UDP / pcap / shmem receiver
 *     -> receiver_data_t {format, audio, audio_size}
 *     -> diretta_output_send()
 *     -> PcmRing (ordered, frame-aligned)                <- the unified queue
 *     -> ScreamDirettaSync::getNewStream() (SDK pull)
 *     -> Diretta SDK send thread -> target
 *
 * The unified queue is owned by the backend and persists across the Sync
 * lifecycle. The receiver thread writes into it during cooldown / open /
 * handshake / steady state. The SDK send thread pulls from it cycle-by-
 * cycle. There is no intermediate batch-drain step; PcmRing is the live
 * queue used by both endpoints.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   diretta_output_init() once at startup (after CLI parse).
 *   diretta_output_send() per Scream PCM chunk.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Opens the Diretta Host SDK once, runs Find to discover sinks.
 *   - Target selection is by index (1-based) into the Find::findOutput() list.
 *   - On format changes, tears down the SyncBuffer asynchronously without
 *     blocking the audio thread, creates a fresh unified queue for the new
 *     format, and reopens with the mapped FormatID. PCM during cooldown
 *     flows into the new queue immediately so the head of the track is
 *     preserved.
 *   - Underrun on the queue produces silence + (optional) rebuffer.
